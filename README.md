# FdF
This project is about creating a simple 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape. X, Y and Z coordinates are linked through lines, creating a wireframe ("fils de fer" in French, hence its name). This is the first graphic project and it introduces the graphics library and some of the mathematics I will be using for future projects.
